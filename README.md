# tower-defense-game

The idea of this game is to build a 2d tower defense game that resembles the type of play such as a Bloons Tower Defense style game would. We will be building this game using Python entirely as well as the Pygame module.

## Contributing to Project

My personal preference is you use the same version of python and any other supporting python packages to make the development proccess as easy as can be. Therefore, I would prefer you use ```Python 3.10.5```. For all the packages, I have created a ```requirements.txt``` file so that all libraries can be installed under the same versions. To do so, make sure you first have ```Python 3.10.5``` installed on your system and then run the command ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` on Windows or ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt``` on Mac.
